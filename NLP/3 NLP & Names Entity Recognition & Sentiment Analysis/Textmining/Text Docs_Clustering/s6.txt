Azhar Mahmood stared with the bat and ball to help the Auckland Aces seal an eight wicket victory against the Hampshire Royals to seal a place in the group stages of the t20 Champions League.

The all rounder picked up five wickets before scoring 55 runs from just 31 balls to help the Aces chase down the Royals total of 121-8 with 33 balls to spare to seal a comprehensive win.

Having won both of their group games the Aces can now look forward to playing in the group stages of the tournament alongside Yorkshire Carnegie who also won their pool after back to back wins tonight.

Yorkshire also cruised to victory thanks in part to Gary Ballance who smashed 64 runs from 37 deliveries to help his side chase down Trinidad & Tobago’s total of 148-9 with seven balls to spare.
