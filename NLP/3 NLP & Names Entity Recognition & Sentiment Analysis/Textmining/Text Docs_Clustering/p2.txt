The Congress high command continues to play truant in taking a decision on the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh on the same old pretext achieving consensus.

AICC in-charge of Andhra Pradesh affairs Ghulam Nabi Azad has once again made it clear in the heart of Hyderabad that it was not so easy to bifurcate the state as it was an extremely complicated issue.

“We cannot compare the Telangana state formation with that of three other states – Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Chattisgarh, where there was a consensus among the people of the regions of divided states. Unless we achieve a consensus among the three regions of Andhra Pradesh, too, the Telangana state cannot be formed,” Azad said.

He, however, did not directly say the Centre would not form the Telangana state.

“We are continuing our negotiations with leaders of all the three regions to arrive at a consensus. We still have to complete the negotiations process,” Azad said.
