The Royal Challengers Bangalore sealed their place in the t20 Champions League final thanks to a six wicket victory over the New South Wales Blues in a another wild shootout at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore.

Faced with a victory target of 204, the Royal Challengers cruised to victory with nine balls to spare to complete their second 200 plus run chase within the space of 48 hours to deny the Blues.

Virat Kohli sealed the victory with a quick fire 84 from just 49 balls after the Royal Challengers lost Chris Gayle (92), Saurabh Tiwary (0) and Mayank Agarwal (7) in quick succession.

Despite the loss of Tillakaratne Dilshan (4) at the end of the third over, Gayle lead the Royal Challengers run chase, smashing eight boundaries and eight sixes before he was dismissed by Pat Cummins (4-45) in the 14th over.

Cummins removed Tiwary and Agarwal soon after but Kohli remained calm to see the Royal Challengers home and seal a place in the t20 Champions League final on Sunday.

It proved to be a disappointing night for the Blues who failed to defend a mammoth total of 203-2 in a innings which saw David Warner score another brilliant century.

Having smashed 135 against the Chennai Super Kings on Monday night, Warner (123) was in destructive mode once again as he dispatched six boundaries and eleven sixes during a 68 ball assault of the Royal Challengers bowlers.

Despite the loss of Shane Watson (3) in the third over, Warner and Daniel Smith (62) put the Blues in control with a second wicket stand of 146 to leave the IPL franchise facing a run chase of 204.
