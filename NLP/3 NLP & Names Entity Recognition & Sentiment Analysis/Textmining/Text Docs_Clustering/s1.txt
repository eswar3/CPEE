The Cape Cobras conceded 24 runs from the final two overs to slide to a two wicket defeat against Trinidad and Tobago to hand the defending champions a semi final life at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

The victory keeps Trinidad and Tobago hopes alive of securing a place in the semi finals while the Cape Cobras crash out of the tournament after losing a game they should have won easily.

Faced with a victory target off 138, Trinidad and Tobago secured victory with two balls to spare thanks to a quick fire 25 from Kevon Cooper who smashed one boundary and two sixes during a vital 11 ball innings in the closing stages.

Having recorded a total of 137-4, the Cape Cobras seemed on course for victory with the West Indian’s needing 40 runs from the final four overs before Cooper stole the show.

Despite a poor start, Dane Vilas (54) and Owais Shah (63) gave the Cape Cobras control of the game thanks to a third wicket stand of 87.

With no other batsman reaching double figures the Cape Cobras seemed 10 – 20 runs short of a competitive total and proved to be the case.

Having secured victory Trinidad and Tobago will now hope the Super Kings beat the New South Wales Blues in a close match in order to secure their place in the semi finals.

A victory for the Blues will see the Aussies through while the Super Kings need to win by a large margin to leapfrog both the Blues and Trinidad and Tobago.
