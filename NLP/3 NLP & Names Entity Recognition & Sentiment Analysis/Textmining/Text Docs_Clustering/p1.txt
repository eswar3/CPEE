Known for his inconsistent political loyalties, Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi president Manda Krishna Madiga has now become a villain for YSR Congress party headed by Kadapa MP Y S Jaganmohan Reddy.

Krishna Madiga, who used to praise late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy for his magnanimity in introducing Arogyasri scheme and coming to the rescue of handicapped people, has once again shifted his loyalties to Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu. He not only participated in the padayatra of Naidu, but also praised the latter’s leadership and his commitment to the SC categorisation issue. Besides, he made some critical remarks against YSR for ignoring the SC categorisation issue.

Naturally, the YSR Congress leaders have taken his comments seriously. Coming down heavily on Manda Krishna, party leaders Mareppa and N Suryaprakash said it had clearly showed that the MRPS president had lacked credibility.

“The Madigas in the state are now hating Manda Krishna for making baseless criticism against YSR. It shows his rank opportunism,” the YSRCP leaders said.
