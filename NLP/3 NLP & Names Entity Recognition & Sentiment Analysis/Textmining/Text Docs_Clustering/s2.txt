David Warner scored the highest ever t20 Champions League total to help send the Chennai Super Kings crashing out of the t20 Champions League after the New South Wales Blues recorded a 46 run victory over the defending champions.

Warner was in stunning form, smashing 135 runs from just 69 deliveries which included eleven boundaries and eight sixes to help the Blues record a mammoth total of 201-2.

The victory seals the Aussies place in the semi finals alongside Group A runners up the Mumbai Indians to leave the Super Kings, Trinidad and Tobago and the Cape Cobras rueing missed chances on a dramatic final round of games in Group A.

Faced with a run chase of 202, the Super Kings had to reach victory by the start of the 17th over in order to increase the run rate to leap frog Trinidad and Tobago and secure their place in the semis.

With an over run rate of 12 needing it was little surprise that the Super Kings came up short; with a mountain to climb the defending champions went out with a whimper after they were restricted to a total of just 155.

Michael Hussey gave the Super Kings some hope with a quick fire 37 but with wickets falling at regular the defending champions crashed out of the tournament just as spectacularly as when Warner batted during the first innings.
