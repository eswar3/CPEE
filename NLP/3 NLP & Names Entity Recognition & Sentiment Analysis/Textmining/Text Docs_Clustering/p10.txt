Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav said on Wednesday that his party won't field candidates with criminal background in the 2017 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. He was speaking at a function to mark the 83rd birth anniversary of late socialist ideologue Janeshwar Mishra. In an apparent dig at his chief minister son Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav said a fact-finding report on his party's defeat rout by the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha battle was yet to be given to him. Terming the coming Panchayat elections a rehearsal for the 2017 assembly polls, he urged party workers to introspect why the Samajwadi Party got only five of the 80 Lok Sabha seats.
