Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC is a model of a detailed plan on how to create, develop, implement and eventually fold the software. It’s a complete plan outlining how the software will be born, raised and eventually be retired from its function. Although some of the models don’t explicitly say how the program will be folded, it’s already common knowledge that software will eventually have it’s ending in a never ending world of change web, software and programming technology.In a rapidly changing world people’ s needs are also changing rapidly. From simple additions to their car engines to a new technology that should be launched online people will always lack something. It is for this reason that you will always find experts from different fields working on new ideas everyday.  The software industry is no...What is Software Development Life Cycle In this chapter we’ ll be looking on SDLC as a tool for development what are the factors for its proper implementation and special section on software security from the point of view of SDLC. These topics will guide us in knowing the important of SDLC in a web developer or programmers life which will...SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle refers to the steps involved in creating a software from scratch.  During earlier days software used to be scarce and its creation was comparatively easier.  Developers could create any programs they want and experience no competition. In present time every software released to the public can easily. What is RAD One of the conveniences of developing software is that it is not a physical tool that can be lost once it gets developed or manufactured. Codes are used to implement the software and it does not disappear together with the product. We can re-use the code all over again in another software. We just make a little change in the interface...
